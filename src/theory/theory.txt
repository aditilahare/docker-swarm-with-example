* Things to know before Docker Swarm :-

    1. What is docker?
        - Docker is a set of coupled software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service products that use
            operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called containers.

    2. What is docker daemon?
        - The Docker daemon is a service that runs on your host operating system which actually build and runs the containers.
        - Its exposes the REST API's.

    3. What is docker cli?
        - It helps to run multiple docker commands which instructs to docker daemon.

    4. What is docker engine?
        - The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

    5. What is docker machine?
        - Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts.
        - And manage the hosts with docker-machine commands.

    6. What is Overlay Network?
        - Overlay network uses overlay network driver which helps to balance the load among a service's nodes.



* What is Docker Swarm?
    Docker Swarm is a Container Orchestration Tool which helps to deployment, scaling and management of container.

* Docker swarm is designed to work around 4 simple principles :-
    1. Simple docker api’s with great user experience
    2. Resilient zero single-point-of-failure architecture
    3. Secure by default with automatically generated certificates
    4. Backward compatibility with existing components

* Difference between Docker Swarm and K8's :-
    1. In Kubernetes, installation is manual and it takes serious planning to make Kubernetes up and running.
       But Docker swarm is simple in architecture and anytime you can join any node to cluster.
    2. You should know Docker CLI to navigate within a structure and then supplemental Kubernetes common language infrastructure to run for those programs.
       Since Docker Swarm is a tool of Docker, same common language is used to navigate within a structure. This provides variability and speed to this tool and gives Docker a significant usability edge.
    3. Kubernetes supports multiple versions of logging and monitoring when the services are deployed within the cluster.
       Docker Swarm is supported for only monitoring with the third party applications.

* Benefits of Kubernetes :-

    1. Kubernetes is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
    2. Kubernetes have an impressively huge community among container orchestration tools. Over 50,000 commits and 1200 contributors.
    3. Kubernetes is an open source and modular tool that works with any OS.
    4. Kubernetes provides easy service organization with pods.

* Drawbacks of Kubernetes :-

    1. When doing it yourself, Kubernetes installation can be quite complex with steep learning curve. An option to solve this issue is to opt for a managed Kubernetes-as-a-service such as ours.
    2. In Kubernetes, it is required to have a separate set of tools for management, including kubectl CLI.
    3. It is Incompatible with existing Docker CLI and Compose tools.

* Benefits of Docker Swarm

    1. Docker Swarm is easy to install with a fast setup
    2. Docker Swarm is a lightweight installation. It is simpler to deploy and Swarm mode is included in the Docker engine.
    3. Docker Swarm has an easier learning curve.
    4. Docker Swarm smoothly integrates with Docker Compose and Docker CLI. That’s because these are native Docker tools. Most of the Docker CLI commands will work with Swarm.

* Drawbacks of Docker Swarm

    1. Docker Swarm provides limited functionality.
    2. Docker Swarm has limited fault tolerance.
    3. Docker Swarm have smaller community and project as compared to Kubernetes community.
    4. In Docker Swarm, services can be scaled manually.
